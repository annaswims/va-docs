The apps we are working on have a react front end written in react in `vets-website` and a ruby on rails api in `vets-api`

Within the broader codebase, our team's front end work is almost entirely contained in `vets-website/src/applications/benefits-optimization-aquia` for the front end. 
For the api, we are are especially interested in files that have `@department-of-veterans-affairs/benefits-optimization-aquia` listed as a codeowner in `vets-api/.github/CODEOWNERS`

Do not consider the folder `scratch` that is my personal scratchpad.

Our team is currently working on 4 different projects simultaneously:
* form 21-2680
* form 21-0779
* form 21p-530a
* form 21-4192
