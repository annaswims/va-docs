## Improvement Ideas
- [ ] We should make a plan to not pass the `X-Key-Inflection` on submit within vets-website, like an optional form config.
- [ ] Revamp ClaimsBaseController - I don't think the actions are used and not overridden anywhere
- [ ] learn about the CentralMailClaim Model and how we might use it for tracking
- [ ] Do we want to use an engine? merely question, not suggestion - mostly so we can deal with less codeowners stuff. 
- [ ] look at using claim.open_struct_form more
- [ ] Look at why the ValidationErrors response messes with the case of the schema in vets-api
- [ ] Add it_behaves_like 'a form filler', debugger option that helps me see the pdf and outputs the data going into the pdf
- [ ] By default, validate schemas when tests run, not with every saved claim being saved
- [ ] Propose moving more docs to somewhere within git/downloadable for AI & search reasons
- [ ] Write forms docs within the codebase 
- [x] Make an index of all/most markdown files within vets-api
- [ ] Tell Platform that https://dev-api.va.gov/v0/swagger/index.html and https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/ are redundant now.
- [ ] https://validator.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=https://dev-api.va.gov/v0/apidocs
- [ ] Swaggger blocks are an evil, unmaintained abstraction.
- [ ] Surely SWAGGERED_CLASSES in app/controllers/v0/apidocs_controller.rb could be automated
- [ ] Ensure hashes from vets-json-schema are frozen
